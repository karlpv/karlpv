```
- Accept everything just the way it is.
- Do not seek pleasure for its own sake.
- Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling.
- Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.
- Be detached from desire your whole life long.
- Do not regret what you have done.
- In all things have no preferences.
- Never stray from the Way.
- To know ten thousand things, know one well
- The dark days are here.
- Gyat
- Preoccupied with a single leaf, you won't see the tree.
  Preoccupied with a single tree, you'll miss the entire forest
```
